Write a C program to add two matrix (e.g.: 2x2) using pointers or arrays (max size should be 4x4). C program to input two matrix from user and find sum of both matrices using pointers.

```
Input matrix1:
1 2
4 5

Input matrix2:
9 8
6 5
```
```
Sum of both matrices:
10 10
10 10
```

The input to the program should be provided in the following way:

```
Input the size: 2 2
Input elements of matrix 1: 1 2 4 5
Input elements of matrix 2: 9 8 6 5

The sum is:
10 10
10 10
```
Please remember about the error handling if the elements are not numbers or if the number of elements in the matrix is not as specified in the size.
