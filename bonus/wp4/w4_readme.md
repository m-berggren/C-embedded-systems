Write a program in C to print all permutations of a given string using pointers. The string should be provided as an argument to your program. The limit of the number of characters in the input is 10. The program should store all the permutations in a large array.

The code should be commented.

For the input

```
permuter.exe abcd
```
The expected output should be:

```
All permutations of the string abcd are:  abdc  acbd  acdb  adcb  adbc  bacd  badc  bcad  bcda  bdca  bdac  cbad  cbda  cabd  cadb  cdab  cdba  dbca  dbac  dcba  dcab  dacb  dabc
```
