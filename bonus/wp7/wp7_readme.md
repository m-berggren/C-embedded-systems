Write a program for calculating and storing Fobonacci sequences. 

The program should take one argument - the Fibonacci number - and then generate the correct Fibonacci sequence. 

The program should store all Fibonacci numbers as a linked list and use the elements in the list to calculate the numbers. For example when calculating the fourth number (3), the program should take the third number (2) and the second number (1) from the list. Recursion is NOT allowed. 

The program should write out the number, for example:

```
Input: main.exe 5

Output: 3
```
